âœ…Project Overview
   This interactive Excel dashboard provides insights into call trends, representative performance, customer responses, and revenue generation. 
It analyzes monthly and weekly trends to optimize call center operations and improve decision-making.
ðŸ“… Call Trends Analysis:
  Peak call volume occurred in March, followed by a decline until August, then an upward trend.
  Sunday & Tuesday require extra representatives for Rep R1 and Rep R2, respectively, to optimize workload.
ðŸ“ž Performance & Revenue Insights:
  Representatives handling more calls generate higher revenue, regardless of call duration.
  Call duration (1 - 1.5 hours) yields the best customer ratings and financial outcomes.
  Customer ratings do not correlate with call duration, indicating quality matters more than length.
ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Decision Making:
  Optimized scheduling for peak days to improve efficiency.
  Insights help allocate resources effectively and boost customer satisfaction.
